## Overview

I created an e-commerce website to show my coding skills. When I started it, I could understand JavaScript on a base level and used the React library for the first time. I planned to upgrade my knowledge of JavaScript and learn the most popular and significant community front-end framework. After I finished MVP of the project, my knowledge of JavaScript was polished, and my understanding of the React library grew.
